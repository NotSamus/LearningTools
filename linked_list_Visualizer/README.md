# Linked List Visualizer

The purpose of this tool is to understand linked list, which is a core concept in CS2 students at the University of Texas at El Paso.

**Disclaimer:** The use of this tool is completely free.

## Future work

- Implement a way to see **step by step** on what happened on each one of the operations of linkedlist
- Make a visual app
